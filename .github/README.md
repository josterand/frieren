  <br><b>【 Josterand's bspwm rice 】</b><br>
  This rice features a minimalist design inspired by the calm, sincere, and kind nature of Frieren from the manga “Sousou no Frieren”. The rice incorporates a dual-bar layout—top and bottom bars—but maintains a clean and focused workspace, allowing users to fully concentrate on what they are doing.

  As long as I'm still using this rice, it will be in the process of development, with plans to continue updating colors, refining details, and possibly new functionality, keeping it fresh and clean.
